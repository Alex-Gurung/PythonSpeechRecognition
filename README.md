# PythonSpeechRecognition
Testing out the SpeechRecognition library for python.(This is mostly for test purposes, there aren't any particular goals with this project)
##Setup
###Speech Recognition
Speech recognition is done through a python library, found here: [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/). Make sure to install.
###Geocoders
In order to take in geographical information, you need the Geocoders python library, found here: [Geocoders](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder).
###Forecast
In order to find forecast information, you need the forecast.io python library, found here: [Forecast.io](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-forecastio/) Make sure to register for an api key, which you can do for free [here](https://developer.forecast.io/).
##How to Run
Simply run the python main.py file and follow the requests for speech input. Keep in mind that audio issues like a lack of speech clarity or surrounding noise will affect the accuracy of the speech recognition.
